At first flash of eden we raced down to the sea<BR>
Standing there on freedom's shore<BR>
<BR>
Waiting for the sun<BR>
Waiting for the sun<BR>
Waiting for the sun<BR>

Can you feel it now that spring has come<BR>
That it's the time to live in the scattered sun<BR>
<BR>
Waiting for the sun<BR>
Waiting for the sun<BR>
Waiting for the sun<BR>
Waiting for the sun<BR>

Waiting, waiting<BR>
Waiting for you to come along<BR>
Waiting for you to hear my song<BR>
Waiting for you to come along<BR>
Waiting for you to tell me what went wrong<BR>
This is the strangest life I've ever known<BR>
<BR>
Can't you feel it now that spring has come<BR>
That it's time to live in the scattered sun<BR>

There's blood in the streets, it's up to my ankles<BR>
She came<BR>
There's blood on the streets, it's up to my knee<BR>
She came<BR>
Blood on the streets in the town of Chicago<BR>
She came<BR>
Blood on the rise, it's following me<BR>
Think about the break of day<BR>
<BR>
She came and then she drove away<BR>
Sunlight in her hair<BR>
<BR>
She came<BR>
Blood in the streets runs a river of sadness<BR>
She came<BR>
Blood in the streets it's up to my thigh<BR>
She came<BR>
Yeah the river runs red down the legs of the city<BR>
She came<BR>
The women are crying rivers of weepin'<BR>
<BR>
She came into town and then she drove away<BR>
Sunlight in her hair<BR>
<BR>
Indians scattered on dawn's highway bleeding<BR>
Ghosts crowd the young child's fragile eggshell mind<BR>
<BR>
Blood in the streets in the town of New Haven<BR>
Blood stains the roofs and the palm trees of Venice<BR>
Blood in my love in the terrible summer<BR>
Bloody red sun of Phantastic L.A.<BR>
<BR>
Blood screams the pain as they chop off her fingers<BR>
Blood will be born in the birth of a nation<BR>
Blood is the rose of mysterious union<BR>
<BR>
There's blood in the streets, it's up to my ankles<BR>
Blood in the streets, it's up to my knee<BR>
Blood in the streets in the town of Chicago<BR>
Blood on the rise, it's following me<BR><BR>

Grandma loved a sailor<BR>
Who sailed the frozen sea<BR>
Grandpa was the whaler<BR>
And he took me on his knee<BR>
He said "Son I'm goin' crazy<BR>
From livin' on the land"<BR>
"Got to find my ship mates<BR>
And walk on foreign sands"<BR>
<BR>
This old man was graceful<BR>
With silver in his smile<BR>
He smoked a briar pipe and<BR>
He walked four country miles<BR>
Singing songs of shady sister<BR>
And old time liberty<BR>
Songs of love and songs of death<BR>
And songs to set me free<BR>
<BR>
I've got three ships and sixty men<BR>
A course for ports unread<BR>
I've stand at mast let north winds blow<BR>
Till half of us are dead<BR>
Land Ho!<BR>
<BR>
Well if I get my hands on a dollar bill<BR>
Gonna buy a bottle and drink my fill<BR>
If I get my hands on a number five<BR>
Gonna sink that little girl alive<BR>
If I get my hands on a number two<BR>
Come back home and marry you<BR>
Marry you marry you<BR>
