STRANGE DAYS<BR></FONT>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" COLOR="#FF0000" SIZE="2"> Strange days have found us<BR>
Strange days have tracked us down<BR>
They're going to destroy<BR>
Our casual joys<BR>
We shall go on playing<BR>
Or find a new town<BR>
<BR>
Yeah!<BR>
<BR>
Strange eyes fill strange rooms<BR>
Voices will signal their tired end<BR>
The hostess is grinning<BR>
Her guests sleep from sinning<BR>
Hear me talk of sin<BR>
And you know this is it<BR>
<BR>
Yeah!<BR>
<BR>
Strange days have found us<BR>
And through their strange hours<BR>
We linger alone<BR>
Bodies confused<BR>
Memories misused<BR>
As we run from the day<BR>
To a strange night of stone<BR>
<BR>

UNHAPPY GIRL<BR></FONT>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" COLOR="#FF0000" SIZE="2"> Unhappy girl<BR>
Left all alone<BR>
Playing solitaire<BR>
Playing warden to your soul<BR>
You are locked in a prison<BR>
Of your own devise<BR>
And you can't believe<BR>
What it does to me<BR>
To see you<BR>
Crying<BR>
<BR>
Unhappy girl<BR>
Tear your web away<BR>
Saw thru all your bars<BR>
Melt your cell today<BR>
You are caught in a prison<BR>
Of your own devise<BR>
<BR>
Unhappy girl<BR>
Fly fast away<BR>
Don't miss your chance<BR>
To swim in mystery<BR>
You are dying in a prison<BR>
Of your own devise<BR>

HORSE LATITUDES<BR></FONT>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" COLOR="#FF0000" SIZE="2"> When the still sea conspires an
armor<BR>
And her sullen and aborted<BR>
Currents breed tiny monsters<BR>
True sailing is dead<BR>
Awkward instant<BR>
And the first animal is jettisoned<BR>
Legs furiously pumping<BR>
Their stiff green gallop<BR>
And heads bob up<BR>
Poise<BR>
Delicate<BR>
Pause<BR>
Consent<BR>
In mute nostril agony<BR>
Carefully refined<BR>
And sealed over<BR>
<BR>

MOONLIGHT DRIVE<BR></FONT>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" COLOR="#FF0000" SIZE="2"> Let's swim to the moon, uh huh 
<BR>
Let's climb through the tide<BR>
Penetrate the evenin' that the<BR>
City sleeps to hide<BR>
<BR>
Let's swim out tonight, love<BR>
It's our turn to try<BR>
Parked beside the ocean<BR>
On our moonlight drive<BR>
<BR>
Let's swim to the moon, uh huh<BR>
Let's climb through the tide<BR>
Surrender to the waiting worlds<BR>
That lap against our side<BR>
<BR>
Nothin' left open<BR>
And no time to decide<BR>
We've stepped into a river<BR>
On our moonlight drive<BR>
<BR>
Let's swim to the moon<BR>
Let's climb through the tide<BR>
You reach your hand to hold me<BR>
But I can't be your guide<BR>
<BR>
Easy, I love you<BR>
As I watch you glide<BR>
Falling through wet forests<BR>
On our moonlight drive, baby<BR>
Moonlight drive<BR>
<BR>
Come on, baby, gonna take a little ride<BR>
Down, down by the ocean side<BR>
Gonna get real close<BR>
Get real tight<BR>
Baby gonna drown tonight<BR>
Goin' down, down, down<BR>

Cancel my subscription to the Resurrection<BR>
Send my credentials to the House of Detention<BR>
I got some friends inside<BR>
<BR>
The face in the mirror won't stop<BR>
The girl in the window won't drop<BR>
A feast of friends<BR>
&quot;Alive!&quot; she cried<BR>
Waitin' for me<BR>
Outside!<BR>
<BR>
Before I sink<BR>
Into the big sleep<BR>
I want to hear<BR>
I want to hear<BR>
The scream of the butterfly<BR>
<BR>
Come back, baby<BR>
Back into my arm<BR>
We're gettin' tired of hangin' around<BR>
Waitin' around with our heads to the ground<BR>
<BR>
I hear a very gentle sound<BR>
Very near yet very far<BR>
Very soft, yeah, very clear<BR>
Come today, come today<BR>
<BR>
What have they done to the earth?<BR>
What have they done to our fair sister?<BR>
Ravaged and plundered and ripped her and bit her<BR>
Stuck her with knives in the side of the dawn<BR>
And tied her with fences and dragged her down<BR>
<BR>
I hear a very gentle sound<BR>
With your ear down to the ground<BR>
We want the world and we want it...<BR>
We want the world and we want it...<BR>
Now<BR>
Now?<BR>
Now!<BR>
<BR>
Persian night, babe<BR>
See the light, babe<BR>
Save us!<BR>
Jesus!<BR>
Save us!<BR>
<BR>
So when the music's over<BR>
When the music's over, yeah<BR>
When the music's over<BR>
Turn out the lights<BR>
Turn out the lights<BR>
Turn out the lights<BR>
<BR>
Well the music is your special friend<BR>
Dance on fire as it intends<BR>
Music is your only friend<BR>
Until the end<BR>
Until the end<BR>
Until the end!<BR>
