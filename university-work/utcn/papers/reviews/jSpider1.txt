Dear Author,

The review process for PPPJ 2003 has completed, and I am sorry to
inform you that, based on these reviews, it has not been possible to
accept your paper as a full paper for the conference.

However, since the subject matter of your paper has been judged
relevant to PPPJ 2003, we will be able to accept your paper for
abbreviated presentation as an extended abstract.  The size of the
paper is limited to three pages and will, of course, appear in the
conference proceedings.

There were 86 submissions to PPPJ 2003 in total, and each paper was
reviewed anonymously by at least two reviewers from independent
institutions.  Based on these reviews we have accepted a total of 39
full papers, and a further 18 papers in extended abstract format.

The reviewers' marks and/or comments will follow in a subsequent email;
I hope they will help you in preparing the final version of your paper.

Please note that the closing date for receipt of registration fees and
camera-ready versions of your paper is 7th April, 2003.  In order for
the paper to appear in the conference proceedings we must receive your
camera-ready copy on time, and at least one member of the author team
must register for the conference.

The registration for is available from www.pppj.org; details of
preparing your camera-ready copy will be made available on the
conference web site over the next few days.

I hope we will see you in Kilkenny in June,

James Power
(for the PPPJ 2003 organisers)
