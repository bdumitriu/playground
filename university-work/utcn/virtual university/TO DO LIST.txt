When some "to do' is done, remove the entry from this file
(but only if it is completely & thoroughly done).

*** make the chat work properly!!! For example, if you click
on Start chat with a certain user, leave the opend applet
running and then click again with the same user, the server
goes down for good and nothing works anymore. The chat system
should be thoroughly tested & fixed. (Tudor)

*** modify sp_... to delete all records in User_Message table
when a message contents is updated. (Bogdan)

*** add a few "Back" buttons here and there, where their absence
is felt (e.g. if you delete/update something (Announcement,
Conference, Task, etc.) you get a "... has been deleted/updated
successfully and then you have to click List ... all over again
to delete something else. (Bogdan)

*** add:
	a) "Delete all" buttons;
	b) checkboxes to select more things to delete at once.

*** create a "Tips & tricks & tricky things" files for the entire
project (where we have to specify stuff like: "call Tools.replaceHTMLChars(...)
when you create text using jsp in a value parameter (e.g.
<input type="text" value="<%= ... %>" /> or you won't get any text if it
is enclosed in double quotes", "if you use the {call sp_name
@parmam=value,...} you might run into problems", etc.) (not assigned yet)

*** filter all stored procedure String parameters through
substring(0, database_field_size-1) in order to avoid errors when
inserting/updating stuff due to field dimension limitations.
(not assigned yet)

*** add help messages where they are needed (as in Add task, for example).
(not assigned yet)

*** update the Announcement (and other, if any) tables to use
class_id & idx as primary key instead of announcement_id.
(Tudor)

*** see what happens when there are errors in the .xml files.
(Bogdan)

*** solve the problem with data enable when hitting "Back" in the
browser in the Conference & Announcement pages. Also fix the following
situation: when an announcement only has an end date or a start
date (but not both) and is displayed for editing, the checkbox
for the missing date is initially disabled, even though the "announcement
should be visible" radio button is selected. (not assigned yet)

*** modify code that makes comparison implying dates in order to make
things all right if the date in question is today (e.g. if conference/
announcemnt is supposed to be visible starting with a certain date
(which is today) make this happen as soon as the clock strikes twelve.
This implies setting the hour, minute, second and milisecond parameters
of the day accordingly). See jsp/assignments/ListStudentAssignments.jsp
in the part with 'due date expired'. (Bogdan)

*** check what needs to be (and can be) checked using JavaScript.
(not assigned yet)

*** make some better checks on the dates (e.g. don't allow
start_date > end_date when creating/editing an announcement,
don't allow due date for an assignement to already be expired,
etc.). (not assigned yet)

*** change all

<textarea>
<%= displaySomething() %>
</textarea>

to:

<textarea>
<%= displaySmth() %></textarea>

so that no unwanted new lines are inserted unwillingly. (not assigned yet)

*** find other things which have to be done/fixed and do/fix 'em or
add 'em here. This to do should always be here (it is never completely
taken care of). (everybody who works on this project)
