When I was back there in seminary school<BR>
There was a person there<BR>
Who put forth the proposition<BR>
That you can petition the Lord with prayer<BR>
Petition the lord with prayer<BR>
Petition the lord with prayer<BR>
You cannot petition the lord with prayer!<BR>
<BR>
Can you give me sanctuary<BR>
I must find a place to hide<BR>
A place for me to hide<BR>
<BR>
Can you find me soft asylum<BR>
I can't make it anymore<BR>
The Man is at the door<BR>
<BR>
Peppermint, miniskirts, chocolate candy<BR>
Champion sax and a girl named Sandy<BR>
There's only four ways to get unraveled<BR>
One is to sleep and the other is travel, da da<BR>
One is a bandit up in the hills<BR>
One is to love your neighbor 'till<BR>
His wife gets home<BR>
<BR>
Catacombs<BR>
Nursery bones<BR>
Winter women<BR>
Growing stones<BR>
Carrying babies<BR>
To the river<BR>

Streets and shoes<BR>
Avenues<BR>
Leather riders<BR>
Selling news<BR>
The monk bought lunch<BR>
<BR>
Ha ha, he bought a little<BR>
Yes, he did<BR>
Woo!<BR>
This is the best part of the trip<BR>
This is the trip, the best part<BR>

Pretty good, huh<BR>

Successful hills are here to stay<BR>
Everything must be this way<BR>
Gentle streets where people play<BR>
Welcome to the Soft Parade<BR>

All our lives we sweat and save<BR>
Building for a shallow grave<BR>
Must be something else we say<BR>
Somehow to defend this place<BR>
Everything must be this way<BR>
Everything must be this way, yeah<BR>
<BR>
The Soft Parade has now begun<BR>
Listen to the engines hum<BR>
People out to have some fun<BR>
A cobra on my left<BR>
Leopard on my right, yeah<BR>
<BR>
The deer woman in a silk dress<BR>
Girls with beads around their necks<BR>
Kiss the hunter of the green vest<BR>
Who has wrestled before<BR>
With lions in the night<BR>
<BR>
Out of sight!<BR>
The lights are getting brighter<BR>
The radio is moaning<BR>
Calling to the dogs<BR>
There are still a few animals<BR>
Left out in the yard<BR>
But it's getting harder<BR>
To describe sailors<BR>
To the underfed<BR>
<BR>
Tropic corridor<BR>
Tropic treasure<BR>
What got us this far<BR>
To this mild equator?<BR>

We need someone or something new<BR>
Something else to get us through, yeah, c'mon<BR>

Callin' on the dogs<BR>
Callin' on the dogs<BR>

You gotta meet me<BR>
Too late, baby<BR>
Slay a few animals<BR>
At the crossroads<BR>
Too late<BR>
All in the yard<BR>
But it's gettin' harder<BR>
By the crossroads<BR>
You gotta meet me<BR>
Oh, we're goin', we're goin great<BR>
At the edge of town<BR>
Tropic corridor<BR>
Tropic treasure<BR>
Havin' a good time<BR>
Got to come along<BR>
What got us this far<BR>
To this mild equator?<BR>
Outskirts of the city<BR>
You and I<BR>
We need someone new<BR>
Somethin' new<BR>
Somethin' else to get us through<BR>
Better bring your gun<BR>
Better bring your gun<BR>
Tropic corridor<BR>
