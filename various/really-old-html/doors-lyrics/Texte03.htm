She's walking down the street<BR>
Blind to every eye she meets<BR>
Do you think you'll be the guy<BR>
To make the queen of the angels sigh?<BR>
<BR>
Hello, I love you<BR>

She holds her head so high<BR>
Like a statue in the sky<BR>
Her arms are wicked, and her legs are long<BR>
When she moves my brain screams out this song<BR>
<BR>
Sidewalk crouches at her feet<BR>
Like a dog that begs for something sweet<BR>
Do you hope to make her see, you fool?<BR>
Do you hope to pluck this dusky jewel?<BR>
<BR>
Hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello<BR>
I want you<BR>
Hello<BR>
I need my baby<BR>
Hello, hello, hello, hello<BR>
