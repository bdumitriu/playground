I wanna tell you 'bout Texas Radio and the Big Beat<BR>
Comes out of the Virginia swamps<BR>
Cool and slow with plenty of precision<BR>
With a back beat narrow and hard to master<BR>
<BR>
Some call it heavenly in it's brilliance<BR>
Others, mean and ruthful of the Western dream<BR>
I love the friends I have gathered together on this thin raft<BR>
We have constructed pyramids in honor of our escaping<BR>
This is the land where the Pharaoh died<BR>
<BR>
The Negroes in the forest brightly feathered<BR>
They are saying, "Forget the night.<BR>
Live with us in forests of azure.<BR>
Out here on the perimeter there are no stars<BR>
Out here we are stoned - immaculate."<BR>
<BR>
Listen to this, and I'll tell you 'bout the heartache<BR>
I'll tell you 'bout the heartache and the lose of God<BR>
I'll tell you 'bout the hopeless night<BR>
The meager food for souls forgot<BR>
I'll tell you 'bout the maiden with raw iron soul<BR>
<BR>
I'll tell you this<BR>
No eternal reward will forgive us now for wasting the dawn<BR>
<BR>
I'll tell you 'bout Texas Radio and the Big Beat<BR>
Soft drivin', slow and mad, like some new language<BR>
<BR>
Now, listen to this, and I'll tell you 'bout the Texas<BR>
I'll tell you 'bout the Texas Radio<BR>
I'll tell you 'bout the hopeless night<BR>
Wandering the Western dream<BR>
Tell you 'bout the maiden with raw iron soul<BR><BR>
