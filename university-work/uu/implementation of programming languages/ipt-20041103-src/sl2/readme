I have implemented all three features. You will, however, only
be able to view in what I've submitted the most advanced one
(the one in which only those static links which are accessed at
least twice are precomputed).

All modifications are in the SLCodeGen.ag and SLCodeGenEnv.ag
files. Please see comments in these two files for further
explanations.
