	 * Writes <code>length</code> bytes of data from buffer to the file,

	 *	want to write a number of bytes which would bring the file pointer
	 *	(at the end of the operation) somewhere before the end of file or
	 *	exactly on the end of file, no extra space is allocated, the file
	 *	remains exactly the same size and <code>length</code> bytes are
	 *	overwritten starting with the file pointer position.</li>
	 * <li> if the file pointer initially points before the end of file and you
	 *	want to write a number of bytes which would bring the file pointer
	 *	(at the end of the operation) somewhere after the end of file, the
	 *	size of the file will change, extra block(s) will be allocated if
	 *	necessary (if there isn't enough space left in the current last block),
	 *	the end of file will be changed to reflect the changes and the the bytes
	 *	will be written partially over the old ones and partially in the
	 *	new space. No assumptions should be made regarding the bytes left
	 *	in the new last block of the file after the end of file position.</li>
	 * <li> if the file pointer points exactly at the end of file, writing will
	 *	begin after the last byte in the old file, the file size will be
	 *	changed, extra block(s) will be allocated if necessary and the end
	 *	of file will be changed to reflect the changes.</li>
	 * <li> if the file pointer points somewhere after the end of file, the
	 *	bytes will be written starting from there and garbage will be left
	 *	between the old end of file and the file pointer (garbage = whatever
	 *	there is in the allocated blocks). The file size will change, extra
	 *	block(s) will be allocated both for the 'garbage' space and for the
	 *	bytes you want to write and the end of file will be changed to reflect
	 *	the changes.</li>
	 * </ul>
	 *
	 * In all of the cases above, the inode's data will be modified to keep it
	 * consistent.

	 * <ul>
	 * <li> NotEnoughSpaceException* if there are not enough free blocks left
	 *	to accomodate the data to be written. If the exception is thrown,
	 *	nothing will be modified (i.e., no bytes will be written).</li>
	 * <li> FileSizeTooLargeException* if the inode does not have enough addressing
	 *	space for the new file size or if the new size of the file would be
	 *	larger than MAX_LONG_INT. If the exception is thrown, nothing
	 *	will be modified (i.e., no bytes will be written).</li>
