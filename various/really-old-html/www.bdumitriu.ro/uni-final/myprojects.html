On this page you can find a list of projects I have worked on during university. Since virtually
all of my working time throughout these years has been dedicated to these projects, I urge you to
regard them as my work experience up to this point (as opposed to regarding them as something worthless).
I have included here only those projects which meet the following two conditions:
<ul>
<li>are directly related to Computer Science (i.e. I have left out various projects I did for subjects like
Mechanics, Numerical Circuits and the like)</li>
<li>are somewhat large in content (i.e. I have left out several first and second year projects which
seemed too 'small' to include here)</li>
</ul>
I have listed these projects under two different headings:
</div>
<ul>
<li><a href="#sa" class="normal"><b>school assignments</b></a> - list of projects I have worked on as semester assignments for
various subjects</li>
<li><a href="#ew" class="normal"><b>extra work</b></a> - list of projects I have worked on with various faculty members during
my time off-school</li>

Text classification using kernel methods (see <a href="http://www.kernel-machines.org/" target="parent" class="normal">http://www.kernel-machines.org/</a>).
This project was based on two research papers, one of them presenting a novel method for
text classification (<a href="http://www.ai.mit.edu/projects/jmlr/papers/volume2/lodhi02a/lodhi02a.pdf" target="parent" class="normal">Text classification using string kernels</a>)
and the other a simplified method for using support vector machines, namely the <a href="http://diwww.epfl.ch/mantra/tutorial/english/ka.pdf" target="parent" class="normal">Kernel-Adatron algorithm</a> (only
the algorithm is available online. The actual paper isn't). I have adapted and tested the method
presented in the former article on the standard collection of texts used for text classification:
the Reuters-21578 database of Reuters articles. The results I achieved were encouraging, but there
was still a lot of work to do on the efficiency of the implementation.

The largest project I have worked on until now is called "Coned Virtual University".
Basically, it is a web programming project aimed at creating a virtual space usable by
both students and teachers for learining / teaching purposes. A colleague of mine and
I have started this project from scratch, under the supervision of the teacher in charge
of the laboratory we worked in (distributed systems lab), creating a software architecture
for the entire system and then developing the application itself.
<br /><br />
The main features of the system are:
<ul>
<li>static materials presentation (presentation of course specific materials)</li>
<li>dynamic material presentation (presentation of class specific materials)</li>
<li>conference services (area where topic based message exchange takes place)</li>
<li>chat room services (area where real-time general purpose conversation takes place)</li>
<li>email services (a means of contact among members of a class ? teacher and students)</li>
<li>announcement services (a means for the teacher to announce class related events)</li>
<li>task assignment (a means for the teacher to assign tasks to the students)</li>
<li>task submission (a means for students to submit solved tasks back to the teacher)</li>
<li>task tracking (a means for students to track the status of their submitted task)</li>
<li>grading book (area where the teacher can award grades to his students)</li>
</ul>
<br />
The project can currently be found at this address: <a href="http://www.coned.utcluj.ro/" target="parent" class="normal">http://www.coned.utcluj.ro/</a> but,
unfortunatelly, hardware problems with the computer running the database server prevent
if from being usable at this time. I hope these problems will be solved as soon as
funds are available for the lab.

A so-called agent 'framework'. The idea behind the project was to create a platform
(agent platform, that is) independent framework which agent-based software programmers
can use to simplify their work. It is not only platform independence that this framework
provides, but also a series of agent behaviours which users can easily add to their
agents. Although the behaviours were designed primarily for agents acting in educational
software (such as our virtual university (see previous project), for example), their
applicability is not reduced to these kinds of environments.
