\section{Project Setting}
\label{sec:project-setting}

This section aims to establish the setup of this thesis project by
presenting a number of tools that our thesis will be based on and by
laying the foundation for some of the topics that will be addressed in
more depth further on. All the technologies discussed in this section
represent the ideas and work of other people; we are merely presenting
them here under a common heading in order to provide the reader with
an easily accessible reference.

\subsection{Stratego/XT}

Stratego/XT is a combination of a language for implementing program
transformations using rewriting strategies (Stratego) and a set of
readily-available transformation tools which can be used for building
complex pipelines of transformations (XT). Stratego/XT has received
substantial attention over the past few years and has undergone
serious development, leading to an abundance of features and
improvements. The research work on the Stratego/XT platform has been
documented in close to one hundred papers up to this point, so it is
in no way our intention to provide anything close to an exhaustive
presentation.  Instead, we only try to offer a quick overview of some
of the basic features which are important for the use we will give to
the language. For a more extensive presentation we refer you to
\cite{bravo05dynrules}, while for a hands-on tutorial we refer you to
the Stratego manual \cite{stratego-manual}.

The general transformation pipeline that is used in Stratego involves
parsing a program to an internal representation (called annotated term
format, or ATerm format), applying a random number of transformations
to this representation to achieve a particular purpose and finally
unparsing (or pretty-printing) the transformed representation back to
program text (not necessarily using the same language as the
original). Stratego/XT already supports parsing and pretty-printing a
wide variety of languages ``out of the box'' (including Java 5.0,
which we are particularly interested in), thereby saving the user a
lot of effort. The user generally has to concern herself only with
writing transformations that manipulate the ATerm representation.

Such transformations are programmed in Stratego by employing a
paradigm based on \emph{conditional rewrite rules}, the application of
which is controlled by \emph{strategies}. Strategies and rewrite rules
can be developed independently of one another, resulting in the
possibility of creating new strategies which implement completely
different transformations than the old ones by simply applying the
same rewrite rules in a different manner. Stratego comes with a large
library of useful strategies which can usually be parameterized with
user-defined strategies in order to achieve various results. This
system makes the writing of transformations simple and attractive.

To illustrate the concepts of rewrite rules and strategies, consider
this very simple example:

\begin{strategocode}
    Fold : Plus(Int(x),Int(y)) -> Int(<addS>(x,y))
    Fold : Times(Int(x),Int(y)) -> Int(<mulS>(x,y))
    Dist : Times(Plus(x,y),z) -> Plus(Times(x,z),Times(y,z))
    Dist : Times(z,Plus(x,y)) -> Plus(Times(z,x),Times(z,y))

    simplify = innermost(Dist <+ Fold)
\end{strategocode}

The first four lines in the code above show the definition of two
rewrite rules and the last line shows the definition of a strategy
that applies the rewrite rules. The \icode{Fold} rewrite rule has the
purpose of evaluating additions and multiplications (we implicitly
assume in the definition that the arguments to \icode{Plus} and
\icode{Times} are integer values), while the \icode{Dist} rewrite rule
applies distribution of multiplication over addition. None of them has
an associated condition. Conditions guard the application of a rewrite
rule and can be specified within an optional \icode{where} clause
followings the rewrite rule. The \icode{simplify} strategy applies the
two rewrite rules in fix point point manner by using the
\icode{innermost} library strategy. \icode{innermost} repeatedly
applies the strategy that is passed to it to all nodes of a tree in a
bottom-up fashion, until it can no longer be applied.

Explaining the full details of the Stratego syntax is beyond the scope
of this presentation, but we will briefly mention here a few things as
a guide to the Stratego code used in this proposal. If you are already
familiar with Stratego, you can safely skip this paragraph. The binary
\icode{<+} operator indicates that first it tries to apply its left
argument and, if that fails, it tries to apply its right argument. It
is very often that one sees something like this in Stratego: $s_1$
\icode{<+} $s_2$ \icode{<+} $\dotsb$ \icode{<+} $s_n$. This simply
means ``try to apply $s_1$, if that fails, try $s_2$, and so on.'' If
none of $s_1, s_2, \dotsc, s_n$ succeeds, the entire construct fails.
An operator related to \icode{<+} is the tertiary operator formed by
\icode{<} and \icode{+}.  $s_1$ \icode{<} $s_2$ \icode{+} $s_3$ tries
to apply $s_1$ and, if successful, applies $s_2$, if not, applies
$s_3$.  Sequential application of strategies is achieved with the
\icode{;} operator ($s_1$\icode{;} $s_2$ applies $s_1$ and $s_2$ in
succession, only applying $s_2$ if the application of $s_1$ was
successful). A strategy can take any number of strategies \emph{and}
terms as parameters (the syntax for this is $s(s_1, s_2, \dotsc, s_n |
t_1, t_2, \dotsc, t_m)$). A strategy is normally applied to the
current term. If instead we need to apply it to a different term, we
can use the following syntax: \icode{<}$s$\icode{>}$t$. Also related
to the current term is the \icode{where} construct, which ensures that
the current term valid before the code enclosed in a \icode{where}
will be reinstated before continuing execution after the \icode{where}
(\icode{where(}$s$\icode{)} is equivalent to \icode{?x; }$s$\icode{;
  !x}). We end our presentation with the two basic constructs of
Stratego: \emph{build} and \emph{match} term. A term is build by
prefixing it with an exclamation mark (\icode{![1,2,3]} builds the
list \icode{[1,2,3]}).  A term is matched by prefixing with the
question mark either a variable (to match the entire term), or a
pattern (to match parts of the term).  For example, \icode{?x} matches
any term and binds variable \icode{x} to it, while \icode{MyTerm(x,y)}
only matches a \icode{MyTerm} with two arguments, binding variable
\icode{x} to the first argument and variable \icode{y} to the second.
The \icode{=>} operator can be used to match a term as well after
first applying the strategy which represents its left argument:
\icode{s => x} is equivalent to \icode{s; ?x}.

We have already seen an example of a library strategy defined by
Stratego which can be customized by the user, \icode{innermost}. There
are numerous other generic strategies defined in the Stratego library,
such as \icode{outermost} (top-down fix point application),
\icode{topdown} and \icode{bottomup} (traverse the abstract
representation top-down/bottom-up and apply a strategy at each node)
or \icode{alltd}, \icode{oncetd} and \icode{sometd} (apply a strategy
to all topmost places where it can be applied, to exactly one such
place or to some of the places). These and many others can be used and
combined and different ways to achieve virtually any conceivable
semantics of a transformation.

The final feature of Stratego that is important to present in this
short overview refers to traversal of terms. This is useful especially
when we need to apply different strategies in different branches of an
abstract syntax tree. To this end, Stratego introduces congruence
combinators. For each $n$-ary term constructor $c$, the strategy
$c(s_1, s_2, \dotsc, s_n)$ is called a congruence. Its effect is that
strategy $s_1$ is applied to the first component of the term, $s_2$ to
the second and so on. The entire strategy is successful if all
$s_i$'s apply successfully. To illustrate, consider the if-then-else
construct in a language, represented in ATerm format as
\icode{If(condition,then-branch,else-branch)}. The \icode{then-branch}
and the \icode{else-branch} will usually contain a statement or a
lists of statements, while the \icode{condition} will be a boolean
expression. Assume we have a transformation which needs to introduce
curly braces (block braces) for if-then-else's that miss them. This
would transform the Java code on the left into the one on the right:

\begin{minipage}{0.5\linewidth}
\begin{javacode}
if (x < 5)
  y++;
else
  y--;
\end{javacode}
\end{minipage}
\begin{minipage}{0.5\linewidth}
\begin{javacode}
if (x < 5) {
  y++;
}
else {
  y--;
}
\end{javacode}
\end{minipage}

In order to achieve this, we need to apply the following
\icode{AddBlock} \emph{conditional} rewrite rule to the
\icode{then-branch} and the \icode{else-branch} of the \icode{If}
term, but not to the \icode{condition}:

\begin{strategocode}
    AddBlock :
      st -> Block([st])
      where <not(?Block(_))>st
\end{strategocode}

In order to do this, we can use the congruence combinator as shown:

\begin{strategocode}
    add-blocks =
      bottomup(try(If(id, AddBlock, AddBlock)))
\end{strategocode}

The \icode{id} strategy leaves its term unchanged, while the
\icode{try(s)} is the same as the simple application of the strategy
\icode{s}, except that it ensures success regardless of the success or
failure of the application of \icode{s}. The \icode{bottomup} strategy
ensures the traversal of the entire tree in a bottom-up fashion (we
could have chosen a top-down traversal just as well, it would have
worked just as well in this case). As a final note, $c(s, s,
\dotsc, s)$ is equivalent to \icode{all(s)}.

\subsection{Dynamic Rewrite Rules}
\label{sec:dynam-rewr-rules}

Dynamic rewrite rules are the feature of Stratego that we are most
interested in, mainly because the first part of out thesis is heavily
related to it. We have seen ``normal'' (or static) rewrite rules in
the previous section. These are defined for the entire length of a
Stratego program and cannot be modified during the execution of a
transformation. However, many times when analyzing a program we need
to take context into consideration, usually by restricting certain
actions only to certain contexts. Dynamic rewrite rules have been
primarily introduced in Stratego to allow easy handling of context
sensitivity.  Context sensitivity can be handled with static rewrite
rules as well, but only in a complex and awkward way. Dynamic rewrite
rules are defined and discussed at length (both formally and
intuitively) in \cite{bravo05dynrules}. An addition to dynamic rewrite
rules called \emph{dependent rewrite rules} was introduced later and
is discussed in another paper \cite{karina05dynrules}. We provide here
a quick summary of what dynamic rewrite rules are and how they can be
used, mostly based on \cite{bravo05dynrules}.

\paragraph{Defining and undefining dynamic rules}

Dynamic rewrite rules are identical in form with the static ones,
except that they are not defined at the top level of a Stratego
program, but within a special \icode{rules} construct, which can
appear in any place a normal strategy can appear. \emph{Defining} a
rule simply means writing it in a such a \icode{rules} construct. The
use of dynamic rewrite rules usually implies using some context
information which is available when the rule is being defined in order
to achieve context sensitivity. For example, we could use such a rule
in a constant propagation transformation to associate variables with
their values when an assignment is encountered:

\begin{strategocode}
    const-prop-assign :
      Assign(x, e1) -> Assign(x, e2)
      where <const-prop>e1 => e2
          ; try( <is-value>e2
               ; rules(ConstProp : x -> e2)
            )
\end{strategocode}

The line \icode{rules(ConstProp : x -> e2)} defines a new dynamic rule
called \icode{ConstProp} which binds variable \icode{x} to constant
expression \icode{e2}. In a top level strategy we can apply the
dynamic rule \icode{ConstProp} just as if it had been defined
statically. If we apply it before it is defined, its application will
simply fail, otherwise it will behave like its static equivalent.

\emph{Undefining} a rule is done by adding the \icode{-} suffix after
the \icode{:}, while only mentioning the left hand side of the
rule. We can now correct the code above so that whenever \icode{e2} is
not a constant value, the rule \icode{ConstProp} is undefined so that
we do not wrongfully propagate the old value variable \icode{x} had
before the assignment:

\begin{strategocode}
    const-prop-assign :
      Assign(x, e1) -> Assign(x, e2)
      where <const-prop>e1 => e2
          ; if <is-value>e2 then
              rules(ConstProp : x -> e2)
            else
              rules(ConstProp :- x)
            end
\end{strategocode}

\paragraph{Scoping dynamic rules}

If we look at our \icode{ConstProp} rule, we realize that it should no
longer be active when variable \icode{x} goes out of scope, to avoid
incorrect replacement of occurrences of \icode{x} that refer to a
different variable \icode{x}. One option would be to undefine the
rules manually at the end of a scope, but this would require horrible
administration in order to know which rules to undefine at the end of
which scopes. Instead, Stratego offers a scoping construct for dynamic
rules which has the semantics that any changes (definitions and
undefinitions of dynamic rules) made within the scoped application are
automatically dropped when the scope is exited. We want to scope our
\icode{ConstProp} rule whenever we enter a block of statements in our
traversal, so instead of this:

\begin{strategocode}
    const-prop =
      ...
      <+ Block(const-prop)
      ...
\end{strategocode}

which simply applies the \icode{const-prop} strategy to the statements
in the block, we can write something like this to achieve the same
effect, but making sure that all effects are dropped after the block
is traversed:

\begin{strategocode}
    const-prop =
      ...
      <+ Block({| ConstProp: const-prop |})
      ...
\end{strategocode}

\paragraph{Labeling scopes}

Scoping is a start, but it is actually not sufficient if we want to
support nested blocks (which are allowed in virtually all programming
languages).  This is because if a variable is defined in a scope, we
need to make sure that all changes to the \icode{ConstProp} rule that
refer to that variable are undefined not when the scope where they are
performed in is exited (as it happens if we use the code above), but
when the scope in which the variable is defined is exited. To
accommodate this, Stratego allows the labeling of scopes with random
terms. Then, once a scope is labeled, we can refer to it by using its
label.  \icode{ConstProp+x} labels the current scope for the the
dynamic rule \icode{ConstProp} with the term that \icode{x} is bound
to.  \icode{ConstProp.x} indicates that the action that follows
(definition or undefinition of the rule) is to be performed relative
to the scope labeled with \icode{x} instead of relative to the current
scope (which is the default). With this syntax, we can finally give
the correct form of (a small part of) the constant propagation
transformation:

\begin{strategocode}
    const-prop =
      ...
      <+ Block({| ConstProp: const-prop |})
      <+ const-prop-var-dec
      <+ const-prop-assign
      ...

    const-prop-var-dec :
      VarDec(x, type) -> VarDec(x, type)
      where rules(ConstProp+x :- x)

    const-prop-assign :
      Assign(x, e1) -> Assign(x, e2)
      where <const-prop>e1 => e2
          ; if <is-value>e2 then
              rules(ConstProp.x : x -> e2)
            else
              rules(ConstProp.x :- x)
            end
\end{strategocode}

The code \icode{rules(ConstProp+x :- x)} both labels the current scope
with \icode{x} and undefines any definition of \icode{ConstProp} for
\icode{x} that might have been valid before the variable declaration.
Furthermore, \icode{const-prop-assign} was changed to define and
undefine \icode{ConstProp} for \icode{x} relative to the scope where
\icode{x} was defined, so that all changes are dropped only when that
scope is exited.

\paragraph{Extending dynamic rules}

In addition to being defined, dynamic rules can also be extended in
Stratego. This means that we can associate multiple right hand sides
with the same left hand side. For this, we use \icode{:+} instead of
simply \icode{:} when we define (well, extend) a rule. If a rule is
extended, applying it will result in applying the right hand side
defined by its last extension. However, there are several ways to
access older extensions as well, but we will discuss those a bit
later. First, let us show an example where extension of rules can be
useful. Consider a language with a \icode{let}-like construct, where
functions can be defined in the preamble and only be used in the
expression of that let. Something like:

\begin{code}
    let
      f x = ...
      g x = ...
    in
      f 5 + g 6
    end
    // f & g no longer visible here
\end{code}

We can imagine a number of analyses which might need to maintain an
environment with the functions that are defined in the current scope.
If we wanted to use a dynamic rule \icode{Env} for this, one option
would be the following (notice our use of scoping in the definition of
\icode{analyze-let} to ensure dropping the newly added functions at
the end of the let):

\begin{strategocode}
    analyze =
      ...
      <+ analyze-let
      <+ analyze-fun-def
      ...

    analyze-let =
      {| Env : analyze |}

    analyze-fun-def =
      FunDef(?f, id, analyze)
      ; where(<Env>() => env)
      ; rules(Env : () -> [f | env])
\end{strategocode}

What we do in \icode{analyze-fun-def} is that we retrieve the old list
of function names, add the new function name to it and redefine the
dynamic rule with the new environment. Since this pattern occurs quite
often, Stratego offers a shortcut for it by allowing extending the
dynamic rules. Behind the scenes the exact same process takes place,
but as far as the user is concerned, she only has to write the
following in order to achieve the same effect as before:

\begin{strategocode}
    analyze-fun-def =
      FunDef(?f, id, analyze)
      ; rules(Env :+ () -> f)
\end{strategocode}

However, there is a catch. Using extension of dynamic rules, when we
apply the rule, we do not get back all the right hand sides, but just
the last one added. This means that in our example above,
\icode{<Env>()} will just return the last function name that was
added. This might be what we want in certain circumstances, but it
also can be (as in our example) that we need access to all
definitions. One function that allows us to do that is called
\icode{bagof-}$L$, where $L$ stands for the name of the dynamic rule.
In our example, \icode{<bagof-Env>()} will return the list with all
the function names. Another useful function is \icode{once-}$L$, which
applies the lastly added right hand side and then drops it from the
list.

\paragraph{Intersection and union of dynamic rules}

Going back to our constant propagation example, consider what happens
when we need to analyze a if-then-else in our target code. We need to
make sure that (1) the rules applied in the then branch and the ones
applied in the else branch do not overlap and (2) the rules valid
after the if-then-else are the result of merging those generated by
the then branch and those generated by the else branch. In the case of
constant propagation, the merging process is done by intersecting the
two sets of rules, but in the case of other transformations, we might
need to merge by taking the union of the two sets of rules. Stratego
offers the \icode{/...\bs} binary operator for intersection and the
\icode{\bs.../} binary operator for union. In both cases, instead of
the \icode{...}, the user has to specify one or more dynamic rule
names separated by commas. What Stratego does is clone the set of
rules valid when the intersection/union operator is encountered, run
each of the two argument strategies with one of the set of rules as
the active one and in the end intersect or take the union of the two
resulting sets, setting the new active set to the result. To
illustrate, here is the code that performs constant propagation over
an if-then-else construct:

\begin{strategocode}
    const-prop-ifthenelse =
      If(const-prop, id, id)
      ; (const-prop
         <+ If(id, const-prop, id) /ConstProp\ If(id, id, const-prop))
\end{strategocode}

We run the strategy \icode{If(id, const-prop, id)} with one set of
rules and the strategy \icode{If(id, id, const-prop)} with its clone,
performing constant propagation over the then and the else branch,
respectively. Afterward, the rules that are common to both branches
are kept, while the rest are dropped.
        
\paragraph{Fix point iteration}

We have a different problem if we need to analyze loops. In the case
of loops, we need to make sure that the set of rules active after the
loop is correct irrespective of how many times (including zero) the
loop is run. For this, Stratego offers two fix point operators, both
of which keep running a strategy over and over until the set of rules
stabilizes. In order to do this, the set of rules that is active
before the fix point operator is cloned and after each iteration the
clone is updated by merging it with the set of rules obtained by
running the strategy. This process continues until the cloned set of
rules does not change from one iteration to the next. Merging can
again be done by intersection or union, hence the two operators:
\icode{/...\bs*} (intersection) and \icode{\bs.../*} (union). As
before, \icode{...} is to be replaced with one or more dynamic rule
names.

Constant propagation over a while loop illustrates how the
intersection fix point operator can be used:

\begin{strategocode}
    const-prop-while =
      While(id, id)
      ; /ConstProp\* While(const-prop, const-prop)
\end{strategocode}
  
The \icode{While(const-prop, const-prop)} is the strategy that is run
until the set of rules stabilizes.

\paragraph{Dependent dynamic rules}

Last on our list of features are the dependent dynamic rules. There
are times when undefining a set of rules when a scope is exited is not
sufficient for our purposes. It can be the case that we need to
undefine rules based on some other ``event''. We do not want to get
into the details of how dependent dynamic rules work, since they are
less important for this thesis. Suffice to say that the mechanism
allows us (1) to specify that a rule is \emph{dependent} on one or
more variables and (2) to undefine all the rules that depend on a
variable. You can read more about dependent dynamic rules in
\cite{karina05dynrules}.

\subsection{Java-front and Dryad}
\label{sec:java-front-dryad}

Java-front \cite{javafront} and Dryad \cite{dryad} are two packages
that form the Stratego support for Java. They are valuable to us since
we will be dealing with transformations that use the Java language as
the target language.  Without such a framework for transforming Java
code available, we would have to spend months on end to provide all
the functionality that is offered by these packages. Fortunately, we
do have them ready for use and all that's left is to focus on the
transformations themselves, given that the rest of the infrastructure
is properly in place.

Java-front supports parsing and unparsing for the full Java 5.0
language. We can parse any program from source code to ATerm, apply
any transformations we like and pretty print the result to obtain Java
source code (as long as the outcome of the transformation is still
valid Java).

Dryad comes with three features. First of all, it provides tools to
transform bytecode to ATerms and back. This is similar to java-front,
except that it supports bytecode, not source code. Secondly, it is
able to perform semantic analysis of parsed Java code in order to
qualify and reclassify names, as well as to annotate all expressions
with their type. Reclassification of names refers to determining
whether an identifier refers to, e.g., a class, a package, a field,
etc., since this is usually ambiguous before such an analysis.
Finally, Dryad offers a number of functions for browsing source code
and byte code in a unified way. We can easily get access to all
methods/fields of a class, the superclasses of a class and so on. All
these features of Dryad are essential if we want to save time on
writing our transformations for Java, mostly because the kind of
support that is made available by Dryad is so generally needed that,
if not already available, it would have to be implemented from scratch
for probably more than 90\% of the transformations.

\subsection{Object Oriented Languages. Java}

As we discussed in the introduction to this proposal, the final goal
of this and other theses will be the implementation of an open
compiler for Java. In our view, Java is simply one very popular
instance of an object oriented language, which we consider for our
research, but our results should not in any way be restricted to Java
only. Java is so well-known by everyone that describing it here would
probably be a waste of space. We will instead use this section to
discuss a number of aspects which we have to take into consideration
in our work towards an open compiler for Java.

The main aspect that differentiates an object oriented programming
language like Java or C++ from an imperative one like C is the
presence of virtual dispatching. Virtual dispatching (or run time
dispatching) ensures that the run time type of an object is taken into
consideration in order to decide which of potentially more than one
methods with the same signature has to be executed. Virtual
dispatching will be explained at more length in section
\ref{sec:program-call-graph}, along with examples. The problem that
virtual dispatching introduces in a compiler is that, unlike with
imperative programming, we can no longer perform interprocedural (or
perhaps the right term should be inter-method) analysis quite as
easily. This is because we cannot always tell at compile time what
method body we need to analyze based on the call site. This creates a
problem that is usually handled by analyzing all potential methods
that might be called at that particular call site and performing some
sort of merging of the results that makes sense in the context of the
particular analysis.

Another difficult aspect that we have to deal with are exceptions.
While exceptions are not strictly a feature of object oriented
programming, their integration in main stream languages has taken
place concurrently with the migration to object oriented languages, so
the two are usually related. Exceptions are difficult to handle by the
compiler because of the complicated control flow paths that they
introduce. Because of this, a lot of compilers for object oriented
languages actually refrain from performing any type of optimizations
of program blocks that contain exceptions, which clearly reduces the
efficiency of the overall optimization process. The problems
introduced by exceptions in the compilation process are further
debated in section \ref{sec:continue-exceptions}.

When dealing with object oriented programs, we are also confronted
with some new types of variables that we have to consider. Imperative
programming used local and global variables along with function or
procedure parameters. Object orientation maintained all these (albeit
global variables were turned into static fields) and added two more:
the object which is the target of a method call (referable with the
\icode{this} variable) and instance fields, which are available in all
non-static methods of a class without their being passed explicitly to
the method. While this is intuitive enough for the user to not create
any problems, it can pose a problem for compilers, since these
variables have to be tracked in a data-flow analysis as well.

Finally, there is another problem related to Java (and probably to
other object oriented languages as well) that is introduced by the
garbage collector. The garbage collector runs in a low priority thread
in the Java Virtual Machine and concerns itself with cleanup of
unreferenced objects. So far, so good, except that aside from
releasing the memory occupied by those objects, the garbage collector
also calls the\icode{finalize} methods on the objects it releases.
This introduces an extra control flow path which has to be considered
by all analyses the compiler performs.

\subsection{TIL}
\label{sec:til}

Last on our list is the Tiny Imperative Language (or TIL) defined
within the core Stratego compiler. TIL is a toy language that is used
to write unit tests for some of the features of the compiler. Stratego
features a complete pipeline for TIL, including a syntax definition
from which a parser is derived as well as a pretty printer for it. TIL
is particularly fit for use in unit tests for the basic Stratego
compiler and library because this enables the independence of the unit
tests from any external libraries (e.g., for parsing and/or
manipulating real languages).

We mention TIL as one of the tools related with this thesis project
because one of the tasks on our list of things to do in the first
phase of the project is to write a full unit test suite for the
dynamic rules library. This library is one of the more complex ones
implemented in Stratego and the lack of a proper unit test suite makes
us reluctant from enhancing it, lest we should break already working
things. Since the dynamic rules library is part of the basic Stratego
library, we intend to use TIL as the (toy) language to use in our unit
tests, for the reason discussed above.
