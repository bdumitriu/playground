CONTENTS
--------
This directory contains
	SL<x>:
	 	compiler versions, <x> in {1..3}, respectively the
		barebones (SLbb), the codegenerating (SLcg) and type inferencing (SLti) version
	bin:
		scripts to start hugs/ghci with the right parameters, tailored
		for the IPT course w.r.t. pathnames
	0<x>0:
		example code used in the lecture notes and slides

USAGE
-----
For example, to compile, run SLcg and run a resulting .ssm file:

> cd SL2
> ../bin/startHugs SLMain.hs
Main> main
Enter filename: test/01.sl
Main> :q
> ssm test/01.ssm

The above is a non-tested sequence, as such it may be different on your system.
In particular path's are UNIX path's, for WinXX replace '/' with '\'.
Also, 'ssm' may not be on your path (on the UU lab machines it is in P:\ipt\SSM).
