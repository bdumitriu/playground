Dear Author,

The review process for PPPJ 2003 has completed, and I regret to
inform you that it has not been possible to accept your paper for
presentation at PPPJ 2003.

There were 86 submissions in total, and each paper was reviewed
anonymously by at least two reviewers from independent institutions.
Based on these reviews we have accepted a total of 39 full papers.

We intend to run a poster session during PPPJ 2003; if you would like
to have your paper considered for presentation in this section, please
let me know before March 26th, 2003.  More details on the poster
session can be found at the conference website, www.pppj.org.

The reviewers' marks and/or comments will follow in a subsequent email;
I hope they will help you in enhancing the value of your paper.

James Power
