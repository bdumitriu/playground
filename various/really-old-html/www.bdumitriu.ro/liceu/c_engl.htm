  Hi, my name is Bogdan Dumitriu, I am 17 years old and I live in a big town in Romania called
Cluj-Napoca. I created this page because I want to correspond to as many people as possible
from all around the world through e-mail. The topics I want to talk to other people about are:

 1. <b>computers</b> - I love computers, they are the passion of my life, I've started to learn every-
thing I could about computers about two years ago and I've made a lot of progress. I know the
Turbo Pascal, C, C++, Fox Pro, Visual Fox Pro, Borland Delphi programming languages (I don't
know very well all of them but I'm learning). I am familiar with the Windows '95, Dos and Unix
operating systems (I am still learnig Unix) and also with a lot of other programs (Microsoft
Office, Adobe Photoshop, Corel Draw, etc.). I also know a little HTML and I intend to start
learning Java soon because I like the Internet.

 2. <b>music</b> - some of my favourite bands are Queen, Metallica, R.e.m., U2, Guns 'n' Roses, Bon 
Jovi, Aerosmith, Roxette, The Doors, My Dying Bride, Tiamat, Lake of Tears, Scorpions, Vangelis.
I also like very much classical music. I don't like all the new styles very much (disco, techno,
punk, rap, ... - they are so many that I can't even remember all of them). I enjoy very much
listening to music from the seventies and eighties - blues.

 3. <b>movies and TV series</b> - I like SF, action, horror, dramas, comedies and good movies in ge-
neral (favourite movies - The Independence Day, The Craft, Interview With a Vampire, The Crow,
As good as it gets, Titanic, Dave, ... oh, there are way to many movies I liked). My favourite
TV series are (were) The X-Files, Seinfeld, Millennium, Highlander, ... Actors I like: Sean
Connery, Harrison Ford, Nicholas Cage, Bruce Willis, Cristopher Lambert, David Duchovny, 
Kevin Costner, Will Smith. Actor I hate: Jean Claude van Damme. Actresses I like: almost all
the beautiful ones, especially Gillian Anderson, Tea Leoni, and so on...

 4. <b>paranormal activity</b> - UFO-s, brain control, psychokinesis, witchcraft, afterlife, parallel
universes, well, actually, I am interested in almost everything that is paranormal.

  So, if anyone would like to send me anything concerning these topics (e-mails with their 
opinions, materials, books, newspaper articles, pictures, etc.) please contact me at this 
e-mail address. I will try to answer as many of your e-mails as I can.
