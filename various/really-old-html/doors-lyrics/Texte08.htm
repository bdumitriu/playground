Awake<BR>
Shake dreams from your hair<BR>
My pretty child, my sweet one.<BR>
Choose the day and choose the sign of your day<BR>
The day's divinity<BR>
First thing you see.<BR>
<BR>
A vast radiant beach in a cool jeweled moon<BR>
Couples naked race down by its quiet side<BR>
And we laugh like soft, mad children<BR>
Smug in the wooly cotton brains of infancy.<BR>
The music and voices are all around us.<BR>
Choose, they croon, the Ancient Ones<BR>
The time has come again.<BR>
Choose now, they croon,<BR>
Beneath the moon<BR>
Beside an ancient lake.<BR>
Enter again the sweet forest,<BR>
Enter the hot dream,<BR>
Come with us.<BR>
Everything is broken up and dances.<BR>
<BR>
Indians scattered on dawn's highway bleeding
Ghosts crowd the young child's fragile eggshell mind.<BR><BR>

Me and my - ah - mother and father - and a<BR>
Grandmother and a grandfather - were driving through<BR>
The desert, at dawn, and a truck load of Indian<BR>
Workers had either hit another car, or just - I don't<BR>
Know what happened - but there were Indians scattered<BR>
All over the highway, bleeding to death.<BR>
So the car pulls up and stops. That was the first time<BR>
I tasted fear. I musta' been about<BR>
Four - like a child is<BR>
Like a flower, his head is just floating in the<BR>
Breeze, man.<BR>
The reaction I get now thinking about it, looking<BR>
Back - is that the souls of the ghosts of those dead<BR>
Indians... maybe one or two of 'em... were just running around<BR>
Freaking out and they just leaped into my<BR>
Soul. And they're still in there.<BR><BR>

Gently they stir, gently rise.<BR>
The dead are newborn awakening<BR>
With ravaged limbs and wet souls,<BR>
Gently they sigh in rapt funeral amazement.<BR>
Who called these dead to dance?<BR>
Was it the young woman learning to play the ghost song on her baby grand?<BR>
Was it the wilderness children?<BR>
Was it the ghost God himself, stuttering, cherring, chatting blindly?<BR>
I called you up to anoit the earth.<BR>
I called you to announce sadness falling like burned skin.<BR>
I called you to wish you well,<BR>
To glory in self like a new monster.<BR>
And now I call on you to pray.<BR><BR>

My friend drove an hour each day from the mountains.<BR>
The bus gives you a hard-on with books in your lap.<BR>
Someone shot the bird in the afternoon dance show.<BR>
They gave our free records to the best couple.<BR>
Spades dance best, from the hip.<BR>
<BR>
The music was new, black polished chrome<BR>
And came over the summer like liquid night<BR>
The DJs took pills to stay awake and play for seven days.<BR>
They went to the studio and someone knew him;<BR>
Someone knew the TV showman.<BR>
He came to our homeroom party and played records<BR>
And when he left in the hot noon sun and walked to his car,<BR>
We saw the chooks had written F-U-C-K on his windshield.<BR>
He wiped it off with a white rag and smiling cooly drove away.<BR>
He's rich. Got a big car.<BR>

My gang will get you.<BR>

The Spanish girl begins to bleed;<BR>
She says period<BR>
It's Catholic heaven.<BR>
I have an ancient Indian crucifix around my neck,<BR>

Back in those days everything was simpler and more confused.<BR>
One summer night, going to the pier,<BR>
I ran into two young girls.<BR>
The blonde was called Freedom,<BR>
The dark one, Enterprise.<BR>
We talked and they told me this story:<BR>
Now listen to his...<BR>
I'll tell you about Texas radio and the big beat.<BR>
Soft driven, slow and mad<BR>
Like some new language,<BR>
Reaching your head with the cold, sudden fury of a divine messenger.<BR>

Wandering, wandering in hopeless night.<BR>

We filed slowly, languidly into the hall.<BR>
The auditorium was vast and silent.<BR>
As we seated and were darkened, the voice continued:<BR>
<BR>
The program for this evening is not new,<BR>
You've seen this entertainment through and through.<BR>
You've seen your birth, your life and death,<BR>
You might recall all of the rest.<BR>
Did you	have a good world when you died?<BR>
Enough to base a movie on?<BR>
<BR>
I'm getting out of here!<BR>
Where're you going?<BR>
To the other side of the morning<BR>
Please don't chase the clouds, pagodas<BR>
Her cunt gripped him like a warm friendly hand.<BR>
It's all right, all your friends are here.<BR>
When can I meet them?<BR>

Amassing for warfare on innocent herdsmen who are just dying<BR>

We live, we die and death not ends it<BR>
