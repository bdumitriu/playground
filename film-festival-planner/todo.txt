Features/Improvements:
======================

* in the schedule view,
  * only show scheduled movies + missed movies (unnecessary venues to be filtered out)
  * replace movie priority with a "Validate" button in movie cell. On hover, an animation should replace the blue pin,
    showing the pin turning from blue to red
  * offer limited controls: the "Validate" button, pinning an unselected movie (others?)

* mark movies for not watching (trash icon?)
* add dots in movie cell for other showings of the same movie

* warnings set + possibility to restore all (send warning configuration as JSON bit array to all pages?)
* on first marking of a movie, a dialog with "Watch whenever" and "Watch exactly on ...", with associated icons, should
  be shown
* on first press on "Propose schedule", a Calibrate dialog should be shown, with what preferences should and should not
  be taken into account, and in what order (prefer schedule with minimal venue changes, use movie priorities, etc.)
  * each proposed schedule could be shown a score (possibly with details about subscores)

* animated icon when communicating with server
* free scheduling / constrained scheduling modes
  * in constrained scheduling, pinning a movie should unpin any movies in conflict with it
    * offer a maximum allowed overlap

* see movie section in day schedule
* priority setting in lineup view
* add constraint versioning functionality, including restore older version
* (maybe) allow undo of accidental clicks in Lineup

UI Ideas:
=========
* ask for profile: 3 movies, 1 a day (using a scheduler is overkill), 15-20, I have a TIFF card and I want to use it,
  sky's the limit
* ask about time: weekend only, weekend + evenings, from ... to ..., mornings, evenings, dawn till dusk, whenever,
  round the clock [intro: Based on your profile we figure you for a ... type of TIFFer, but do tell us if we're wrong]
* then take user to schedule view where he should only be able to select "watch exactly here" movies
* then take him to list view where he should only be able to select "watch anywhere"/"don't wanna watch" movies
* when in list view, he should be able to tell the system: make random selection in remaining time slots
* as user selects movies, make unschedulable ones disappear

Calendar component:
===================
* data model:
  {
      "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-04/schema#",
      "title": "Movie Planner Data Model",
      "description": "The data model backing a movie planner UI component",

      "definitions": {
          "venue" {
              "description": "...",
              "type": "object",
              "properties": {
                  "..."
              }
          }
      }

      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
          "venues": {
              "description": "the list of venues where movies are being shown",
              "type": "array",
              "items": { "$ref": "#/definitions/venue" }
          }
      }
      "required": ["venues"]
  }
  "event": { "$ref": "http: //json-schema.org/calendar" }


Code:
=====
* replace entityManager.find(...) with entityManager.getReference(...) where only the ID of the result is needed
* see about adding @Cache to @Entity classes
* ShowingController does not allow for more than one movie at the same hour because a map hour -> movie is used
* ShowingController#couldNotBeScheduled is computationally expensive - the missed movies should be persisted instead
