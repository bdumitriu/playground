The only changes were made to the file SLJudgements.ag
(and are commented therein). There is one small exception:
the finalSubst attribute has been added in SLTypeInference.ag.
This is the attribute used to resend the final computed
substitution back into the tree so that it can be used
in SLJudgements.ag.
