"Cheshire Puss," Alice began... "Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to
go from here?"
</p>
<p>
"That depends a good deal on where you want to get to," said the Cat.
</p>
<p>
"I don't much care where--" said Alice.
</p>
<p>
"Then it doesn't matter which way you go," said the Cat.
</p>
<p>
"--so long as I get somewhere," Alice added as an explanation.
</p>
<p>
"Oh, you're sure to do that," said the Cat, "if you only walk long enough."

"So... we have what the people are interested in, and human interest stories,
which is what humans are interested in, and the public interest, which no one is

<p>
"Which isn't the same as people and humans?"
</p>
<p>
"I think it's more complicated than that, sir."
</p>
<p>
"Obviously. Do you mean that the public is a different thing from the people you
just see walking about the place? The public thinks big, sensible measured
thoughts while <i>people</i> run around doing silly things?"
</p>
<p>
"I think so. I may have to work on that idea too, I admit."
