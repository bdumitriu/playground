<BR>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" COLOR="#FF0000" SIZE="2"> Lions in the street and roaming 
<BR>
Dogs in heat, rabid, foaming<BR>
A beast caged in the heart of a city<BR>
The body of his mother<BR>
Rotting in the summer ground<BR>
He fled the town<BR>
<BR>
He went down South and crossed the border<BR>
Left the chaos and disorder<BR>
Back there over his shoulder<BR>
<BR>
One morning he awoke in a green hotel<BR>
With a strange creature groaning beside him<BR>
Sweat oozed from its shiny skin<BR>
<BR>
Is everybody in?<BR>
The ceremony is about to begin<BR>
<BR>
Wake up!<BR>
You can't remember where it was<BR>
Had this dream stopped?<BR>
<BR>
The snake was pale gold<BR>
Glazed and shrunken<BR>
We were afraid to touch it<BR>
The sheets were hot dead prisons<BR>
<BR>
And she was beside me<BR>
Old, she's not young<BR>
Her dark red hair<BR>
The white soft skin<BR>
<BR>
Now, run to the mirror in the bathroom<BR>
Look!<BR>
She's coming in here<BR>
I can't live through each slow century of her moving<BR>
I let my cheek slide down<BR>
The cool smooth tile<BR>
Feel the good cold stinging blood<BR>
The smooth hissing snakes of rain...<BR>
<BR>
Once I had, a little game<BR>
I liked to crawl back into my brain<BR>
I think you know the game I mean<BR>
I mean the game called 'go insane'<BR>
<BR>
Now you should try this little game<BR>
Just close your eyes forget your name<BR>
Forget the world forget the people<BR>
And we'll erect a different steeple<BR>
<BR>
This little game is fun to do<BR>
Just close your eyes no way to lose<BR>
And I'm right here I'm going too<BR>
Release control we're breaking through<BR>
<BR>
Way back deep into the brain<BR>
Way back past the realm of pain<BR>
Back where there's never any rain<BR>
And the rain falls gently on the town<BR>
And over the heads of all of us<BR>
And in the labyrinth of streams<BR>
Beneath, the quiet unearthly presence of<BR>
Nervous hill dwellers in the gentle hills around<BR>
Reptiles abounding<BR>
Fossils, caves, cool air heights<BR>
<BR>
Each house repeats a mold<BR>
Windows rolled<BR>
A beast car locked in against morning<BR>
All now sleeping<BR>
Rugs silent, mirrors vacant<BR>
Dust blind under the beds of lawful couples<BR>
Wound in sheets<BR>
And daughters, smug<BR>
With semen eyes in their nipples<BR>
<BR>
Wait<BR>
There's been a slaughter here<BR>
(Don't stop to speak or look around<BR>
Your gloves and fan are on the ground<BR>
We're getting out of town<BR>
We're going on the run<BR>
And you're the one I want to come)<BR>
<BR>
Not to touch the earth<BR>
Not to see the sun<BR>
Nothing left to do, but<BR>
Run, run, run<BR>
Let's run<BR>
Let's run<BR>
<BR>
House upon the hill<BR>
Moon is lying still<BR>
Shadows of the trees<BR>
Witnessing the wild breeze<BR>
C'mon baby run with me<BR>
Let's run<BR>
<BR>
Run with me<BR>
Run with me<BR>
Run with me<BR>
Let's run<BR>
<BR>
The mansion is warm, at the top of the hill<BR>
Rich are the rooms and the comforts there<BR>
Red are the arms of luxuriant chairs<BR>
And you won't know a thing till you get inside<BR>
<BR>
Dead president's corpse in the driver's car<BR>
The engine runs on glue and tar<BR>
C'mon along, we're not going very far<BR>
To the East to meet the Czar<BR>
<BR>
Run with me<BR>
Run with me<BR>
Run with me<BR>
Let's run<BR>
<BR>
Some outlaws lived by the side of the lake<BR>
The minister's daughter's in love with the snake<BR>
Who lives in a well by the side of the road<BR>
Wake up, girl! We're almost home, yeah<BR>
<BR>
Sun, sun, sun<BR>
Burn, burn, burn<BR>
Moon, moon, moon<BR>
I will get you<BR>
Soon!<BR>
Soon!<BR>
Soon!<BR>
<BR>
I am the Lizard King<BR>
I can do anything<BR>
<BR>
We came down<BR>
The rivers and highways<BR>
We came down from<BR>
Forests and falls<BR>
<BR>
We came down from<BR>
Carson and Springfield<BR>
We came down from<BR>
Phoenix enthralled<BR>
And I can tell you<BR>
The names of the Kingdom<BR>
I can tell you<BR>
The things that you know<BR>
Listening for a fistful of silence<BR>
Climbing valleys into the shade<BR>
<BR>
For seven years I dwelt<BR>
In the loose palace of exile<BR>
Playing strange games<BR>
With the girls of the island<BR>
<BR>
Now I have come again<BR>
To the land of the fair, and the strong, and the wise<BR>
<BR>
Brothers and sisters of the pale forest<BR>
Children of Night<BR>
Who among you will run with the hunt?<BR>
<BR>
Now Night arrives with her purple legion<BR>
Retire now to your tents and to your dreams<BR>
Tomorrow we enter the town of my birth<BR>
<BR>
I want to be ready<BR>
