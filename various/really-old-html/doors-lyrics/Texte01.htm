I guess I'd better go now<BR>
I'd really like to stay here all night<BR>

Street lights share their hollow glow<BR>
Your brain seems bruised with numb surprise<BR>
Still one place to go<BR>
Still one place to go<BR>
<BR>
Let me sleep all night in your soul kitchen<BR>
Warm my mind near your gentle stove<BR>
Turn me out and I'll wander baby<BR>
Stumblin' in the neon groves<BR>
<BR>
Well, your fingers weave quick minarets<BR>
Speak in secret alphabets<BR>
I light another cigarette<BR>
Learn to forget, learn to forget<BR>
Learn to forget, learn to forget<BR>

Let me sleep all night in your soul kitchen<BR>

Another flashing chance at bliss<BR>
Another kiss, another kiss<BR>

The days are bright and filled with pain<BR>
Enclose me in your gentle rain<BR>
The time you ran was too insane<BR>
We'll meet again, we'll meet again<BR>
<BR>
Oh tell me where your freedom lies<BR>
The streets are fields that never die<BR>
Deliver me from reasons why<BR>
You'd rather cry, I'd rather fly<BR>

The crystal ship is being filled<BR>
A thousand girls, a thousand thrills<BR>
A million ways to spend your time<BR>
When we get back, I'll drop a line<BR>
