As you told me in the email:

here is a copy of my message:

The problem is that by specifying this kind of priorities the system
doesn't want to parse the expression "not exists a : a" (even thought
it does parse "not (exists a : a)"). The error is "stdin: character ' '
unexpected at line 1, column 11".

If I drop the line containing "not"-production from the priority list,
then the expression "not exists a : a" is parsed correctly. However,
then the expression "not a /\ not b" becomes ambigous, which is normal.

The conclusion is that whichever solution I adopt, there is a problem.
What I don't understand is why in the first case the system decides to
use the priorities, since in my opinion there is no ambiguity when
parsing "not exists a : a" (since there is no other way to parse this
expression than Not(Exists("a",Prop("a")))).

You can also see this in the test called "see README" from the test
suite.
