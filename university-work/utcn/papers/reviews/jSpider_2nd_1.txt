ABSTRACT:
The Integrated Development Environment is an essential ingredient for
achieving increased productivity in writing applications. So far, such tools
are rather scarce in the logic programming world and even the few ones that
exist lack many of the required functionalities. Therefore we tried to
develop such an environment and build it on top of one of the most powerful
and robust Prolog nowadays &#8211; Sicstus Prolog [5]. In this paper, we
describe the methodology we adopted in order to identify our product&#8217;s
requirements and we outline the main features of the resulted product in a
comparative manner. The implementation is done entirely in Java and
therefore benefits from the advantages inherent to the use of the Java
programming language.
