Code:
* merge MySchedule.xhtml and Program.xhtml and control with classes implementing an interface
* replace entityManager.find(...) with entityManager.getReference(...) where only the ID of the result is needed
* see about adding @Cache to @Entity classes
* ShowingController does not allow for more than one movie at the same hour because a map hour -> movie is used

Features/Improvements:
* in the schedule view,
  * only show scheduled movies + missed movies (unnecessary venues to be filtered out)
  * replace movie priority with a "Validate" button in movie cell. On hover, an animation should replace the blue pin,
    showing the pin turning from blue to red
  * offer limited controls: the "Validate" button, pinning an unselected movie (others?)

* mark movies for not watching (trash icon?)
* add dots in movie cell for other showings of the same movie

* warnings set + possibility to restore all (send warning configuration as JSON bit array to all pages?)
* on first marking of a movie, a dialog with "Watch whenever" and "Watch exactly on ...", with associated icons, should
  be shown
* on first press on "Propose schedule", a Calibrate dialog should be shown, with what preferences should and should not
  be taken into account, and in what order (prefer schedule with minimal venue changes, use movie priorities, etc.)
  * each proposed schedule could be shown a score (possibly with details about subscores)

* animated icon when communicating with server
* free scheduling / constrained scheduling modes
  * in constrained scheduling, pinning a movie should unpin any movies in conflict with it
    * offer a maximum allowed overlap

* see movie section in day schedule
* priority setting in lineup view
* add constraint versioning functionality, including restore older version
* (maybe) allow undo of accidental clicks in Lineup
