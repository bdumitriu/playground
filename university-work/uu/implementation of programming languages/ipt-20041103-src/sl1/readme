A list of extra features:
 - tuples with random number of members
 - selection function (called sel) for selecting any member of the tuple
 - relational operators for tuples (==, /=, <=, >=, <, >)
 - pattern matching in lambda function arguments
 - new operator (!!) for selecting elements of a tuple
 - assignment to a (possibly nested) tuple
